#Authoritarianism Resistance Kit

This guide together with the USB drive you received will enable you to communicate securely and anonymously use the internet while living under the watch of an authoritarian government. These are simple, effective, and tested methods. 

##Disclaimers

###A Note About Safety

The only 100% way to be safe under an authoritarian government is to not resist. Realize that authoritarian governments set arbitrary rules for what is and is not a "National Security Threat". Under some countries, even posessing an encrypted disk is enough to land you in an interogation room. Despite what others may tell you, you are always free to choose the path of least resistance if that means keeping yourself and your family safe. History is written by survivors. 

Via this guide you will be personalizing the USB drive. It is recommended that you keep it hidden. Though your drive will be encrypted, the best security is apparent non-existence. 

###What This Kit Can Do / What It Can't

If used properly, this kit will allow you to browse the internet securely, communicate securely, and send and receive data securely. In this context, secure means "as good as possible for a novice", which is still fairly secure. 

This kit can not guarantee your safety, nor can it help you choose people to trust. Remember that humans are always the simplest exploit in a system. If you let a spy into the network of trust, your network is compromised. 

###If I'm Reading This, Can't Anybody?

Yes. This guide is open and available to anybody. The tools are open and available to anybody. Knowing the tools and methods will not help a third party break the security, and we should always assume they know what tools we're using and how we're using them. That is why we have strict protocols. 

It is also important to expose these tools and methods to a wide audience, so that they might be revised for maximum effectiveness over time. 

##The Kit

This kit has five main components:

1. The TAILS operating system (The Amnesiac Incognito Live System), which you are running right now via USB stick
2. The TOR browser / network, which allows you to bounce your computers IP Address (similar to a telephone number or postal address) off a series of relays to hide its origin
3. The JABBER instant messaging protocol with OTR (Off The Record) encryption for secure instant messaging
4. Secure and anonymous email
5. The Signal app for secure texting

The tools themselves are only part of the kit. You must also use them correctly and follow strict protocols. 

##About the Tools 

[jump to how to use the tools](#howtotools)

###1. TAILS Operating System

**Rule #1** Never do any of these activities from your normal computing account. Always boot to TAILS via the USB drive.

TAILS allows you to operate any computer while leaving no trace. It is an open-source linux distribution that is self-contained and designed for security. It will clear your system memory every time you exit. 

###2. TOR Browser / Network

The Onion Relay (TOR) is a network of volunteer nodes that allow you to bounce your internet signal around the globe. A snooping third party would not be able to locate you based on your origin, since they would only be able to locate the final exit node. 

TOR is not 100% safe, but when used with TAILS it provides decent safety for a novice. 

**Rule #2** Never log into any personalized service while using TOR. No facebook, amazon, gmail, etc. If you log in, your identity is compromised. 

###3. Jabber Instant Messaging Protocol

Jabber is an open-source instant messaging protocol that you can register anonymously. It supports OTR (Off the Record) encryption, which will allow you to talk with contacts such that a snooping third party will only see encrypted messages. 

**Rule #3** Always re-authenticate your contact when you start speaking. This may seem like a hassle, but it is the only way to guarantee your contact has not been compromised. See below on how to do this.

*Question: what if my contact is being coerced?* If for your secondary question your contact gives a wrong answer that is close to the right answer, they are sending a signal that they are being coerced. For instance, if you ask "Who is Marge's husband in the Simpons?" and they answer "Gomer", you should play along and pretend to continue the chat. Give wrong information or be vague. This will guarantee their safety (at least immediately). 

###4. Anonymous email
