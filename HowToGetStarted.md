#Authoritarianism Resistance Kit

This guide together with the USB drive you received will enable you to successfully communicate and use the internet while living under the watch of an authoritarian government. These are simple, effective, and tested methods. 

##Disclaimers

###A Note About Safety

The only 100% way to be safe in an authoritarian government is to not resist. Realize that authoritarian governments set arbitrary rules for what is and is not a "National Security Threat". Under some countries, even posessing an encrypted disk is enough to land you in an interogation room. Despite what others may tell you, you are always free to choose the path of least resistance if that means keeping yourself and your family safe. History is written by survivors. 

###What This Kit Can Do / What It Can't

If used properly, this kit will allow you to browse the internet securely, communicate securely, and send and receive data securely. In this context, secure means "as good as possible for a novice", which is still fairly secure. 

This kit can not guarantee your safety, nor can it help you choose people to trust. Remember that humans are always the easiest exploit in a system. If you let a spy into the network of trust, your network is compromised. 

###If I'm Reading This, Can't Anybody?

Yes. The instructions here are open and available to anybody. The tools are open and available to anybody. Knowing the tools and methods will not help a third party break the security, and we should always assume they know what tools we're using and how we're using them. That is why we have strict protocols. 

It is also important to expose these tools and methods to a wide audience, so that they might be revised for maximum effectiveness over time. 

##The Kit

This kit has five main components:

1. The Tails operating system (The Amnesiac Incognito Live System), which you are running right now via USB stick
2. The TOR browser / network, which allows you to bounce your internet address off a series of relays to hide its origin
3. The JABBER instant messaging protocol with OTR (Off The Record) encryption for secure instant messaging
4. Secure and anonymous email
5. The Signal app for secure texting

The tools themselves are only part of the kit. You must also use them correctly and follow strict protocols.
